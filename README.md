PAPRIKA is Command Line Parser like a toy.

PAPRIKA is a product for learning Rust and version control.

If you need a good command line parser,
You should use Clap instead of PAPRIKA.


```
[dependencies]
paprika = "*"
```

Well, this is just killing time.

By the way, I am not good at English. I would be very happy to tell if there are any strange grammars.
